<h2>What is hearts?</h2>

<p>Hearts is a little card game played with four persons (it is also possible to play it with three though taking the eights, nines, tens and a two, normally I take out the two of diamonds).
<p>A computer version of the game comes with Windows and is a pretty popular little thing. When I switched to using Linux, I really wanted to play it, but I didn't find anything at all, so I decided to write it myself and here it is.
<p>Right now there are two versions: A stable (more or less) version, which only supports local play and an unstable development version which supports network play, &lt;understament&gt;but has a couple of features missing&lt;/understatement&gt;.

<h2>What's New:</h2>

<h3>A hearts server where you can find other players on the internet was set up.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A new version is in the works. Right now you can access it through <a href="download.php#CVS">anonymous CVS</a>, and more traditional release modes are planned.
	<li>A public hearts server was put online thanks to Pavel Troller who volunteered space on a machine of his. Thanks also to Imre, Nagy Jr who also volunteered some space.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 1.92</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The setup is different and not a separate program (which will allow me to set up error handling later)
	<li>A couple of display bugs fixed
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 1.2pre6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One bug fixed
	<li>A dutch translation was added thanks to Japie
</ul>

<p>You can see every change in <a href="history.php">the history page</a>.
